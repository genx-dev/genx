This is [**GenX**](http://genx.sourceforge.net/), which is a X-ray and Neutron reflectivity fitting program and originally written by **Matts Bj√∂rck**, ported to Python 3 and wxPython Phoenix. Codes that were originally dependent on scipy.weave were re-written in Cython. This is work in progress and the port is not yet completely stable. The port is based on the latest Genx version 2.4.10 and is intended to superseed it. haozhangphd did most of the porting of the code.

Some caveats of this version include the following:
1. I have only tested on GNU/Linux, however there is no reason why it will not work on other platforms. The code itself should be platform-neutral, and only `setup.py` needs to be modified in order to install the program on other platforms.
2. While this Python 3 version can open both the .gx and .hgx files saved by the Python 2 version, it can not save the .gx files due to the change in the Python pickle protocol. I have changed the extension of the saved files from .gx to .gx3 to highlight this incompatibility. If interoperability with the Python 2 version is desired, please use .hgx format.  

Apart from the save file caveat mentioned above, this version is compatible with **both** Python 2 and Python 3, provided wxPython Phoenix is installed. To install this program, please run either `sudo python2 setup.py install` or `sudo python3 setup.py install`, depending on the Python version.
